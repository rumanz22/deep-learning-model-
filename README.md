Project Overview: Deep Learning Term Project
The project focuses on brain tumor classification using deep learning techniques. Specifically, it employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI brain images into different tumor categories.

üìÇ Dataset
Source: The dataset contains MRI images of brain tumors categorized into different types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor).

Preprocessing:

Image resizing to 150x150 pixels.

Normalization by scaling pixel values to [0, 1].

Data augmentation to increase dataset variability (rotation, zoom, flip, etc.).

üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture
The project defines and trains a CNN model with the following structure:

Conv2D layers with ReLU activation.

MaxPooling2D for downsampling.

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Flatten followed by Dense layers for classification.

Softmax in the output layer (for multi-class classification).

Loss function: categorical_crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam

üìä Training and Evaluation
Train-validation split: The data is divided into training and validation sets.

Metrics used: Accuracy, loss.

Evaluation:

Training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted.

Confusion matrix is shown.

Classification report includes precision, recall, and F1-score.

A test dataset is used to evaluate final performance.

üìà Visualization
Accuracy/loss curves help detect overfitting or underfitting.

Confusion matrix provides insight into the class-wise performance.

Predictions on sample images are shown with true/false labeling.
